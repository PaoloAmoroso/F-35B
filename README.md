Lockheed-Martin F-35B Lightning II for FlightGear

The Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II is a short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) capable, single-engine, supersonic fifth-generation stealth strike fighter. A multirole combat aircraft designed for both air superiority and strike missions, it also has electronic warfare and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. The aircraft descends from the Lockheed Martin X-35, which in 2001 beat the Boeing X-32 to win the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program intended to replace the F-16, F/A-18, and the Harrier jump jet, among others. The F-35 is expected to be continually upgraded over its lifetime.
